     * Q. What is Number System?
     * => Method to represent numeric values or quantities using different digits.
     * 
     * Q. How the numbers are represented?
     * => 7459
     * => 7 -> Thousands    => 7000
     * => 4 -> Hundreds     =>  400
     * => 5 -> Tens         =>   50
     * => 9 -> Ones         =>    9
     * Decimal Numbers      => 7459 => means base is 10.
     * 
     * Q. Which number we modify such that 7452 will be least changed?
     * => Ones part of the number => 7452 + 1  => 7453
     * 
     *  Q. Which number we modify such that 7452 will be most changed?
     * => Thousands part of the number => 7452 + 1000 => 8452
     * 
     * Note: Can we say:
     * (a) Ones(right most digit) => least significant digit
     * (b) Thousands (left most digit) => most significant digit
     * => This is the number system that we use in our day-to-day life.
     * 
     * 
     * Different number systems: (4 most used number system)
     * 1. Decimal Number System => [0 to 9] => Base 10
     * 2. Binary Number System (Machine uses) => [0 to 1] => Base 2
     * 3. Octal Number System => [0 to 7] => Base 8
     * 4. Hexadecimal Number System => [0 to 9 & A to F] => Base 16
     * 
     * 
     * Example:
     * (a) (1010)base2  => Binary Number
     * (b) (672)base8   => Octal Number
     * (c) (2364)base16 => Hexadecimal Number
     * (d) 550          => Decimal Number
     * Note: If no base is mentioned then we can assume it as decimal number.
