Recursion Foundation:
1. Print Decreasing
2. Print Increasing
3. Print DecreasingIncreasing
4. Factorial
5. Power Linear
6. Power Logarithmic 
7. Print Zig Zag
8. Tower of Hanoi

(a) Print Decreasing: 
=> EK baar upar gye aur niche aae.
=> But Motion upar jaate hue kaam kr rha hai

(b) Print Increasing:
=> Motion niche jaate hue kaam kr rha hai

(c) PrintDecreasingIncreasing:
=> Motion upar jaate hue v kaam kiye aur niche aate hue v.

(d) Factorial:
=> Motion upar jaa k niche aate hue kaam kiya but the only difference
   is isme value return hogi.

(e) Power Linear:
=> Wapas aate hue kaam hoga

(f) Power Logarithm:
=> Chota tree banega but wapas aate hue kaam hoga

(g) Print Zig Zag:
=> Pehli baar motion ka tree banega

(h) Tower of hanoi:
=> Isme v tree bangea
=> With Tower of Hanoi, we will understand sometimes it is not possible
   to solve question iteratively.


Q. Why to avoid recursion?
=> Qki wo space jyda khaata hai, but time same lagega.
=> With Tower of Hanoi, we will understand sometimes it is not possible
   to solve question iteratively. Because on each recursive call it
   will create LEC in Stack.
