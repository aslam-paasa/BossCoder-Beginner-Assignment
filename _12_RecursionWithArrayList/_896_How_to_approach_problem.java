     * Q. How to understand and approach a problem?
     * => Follow these important steps:
     *    1. Identify if you can break down problem into smaller prob.
     *    2. Write the recurrence relation(formula) if needed.
     *    3. Draw the recursive tree
     *    4. About the tree:
     *       a. See the flow of functions, how they are getting in stuck.
     *       b. Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls.
     *       c. Draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen and
     *          paper.
     *       d. Use a debugger to see the flow.
     *    5. See how the values & what type of values(int, string etc) are 
     *       returned at each step. See where the function call will come 
     *       out. In the end you will come out of the main() fn.
