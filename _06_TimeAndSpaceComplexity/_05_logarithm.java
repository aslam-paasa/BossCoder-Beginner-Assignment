         *  => This is what log is.
         * 
         *  => For example, log2 16 means how many no. of 2's we need to multiply to make 16. => 4
         *  => For example, log3 81 => how many no. of 3's we need to multiply to make 81. => 4
         *  => For example, log7 343 => how many no. of 7's we need to multiply to make 343. => 3
         *  => For example, log2 512 => how many no. of 2's we need to multiply to make 512 => 9
         * 
         * (1) loga a^b = b
         *  => Here we can asking how many no. of a's we need to multiply to get 'a^b' => 'b' times.
         *  => How many times we need to multiply 2 so that we will get 2^4? => 4 times.
         * 
         * Note: Exactly there is no way to reduce it, but there are 4 formual's of logarithm that
         *       we can use to reduce it to smaller things.
         * Note: Read the formula
